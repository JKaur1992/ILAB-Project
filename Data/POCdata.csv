i.	Why is this KI prioritized: She needs to have a plan in place within the next 30-60 days. What has she done so far? She has done quite a bit- she has identified the critical roles (their Senior VP of Operations and others of what she calls the “core leadership positions”) She has created plans to develop the high potentials through STRETCH ROLES- (I told her that the research agrees with her) and then after they have their individual learning, the second phase is to develop them in a group setting so there is what she calls a “community of learning” which is “a cohort structure” an “intimate group setting” where they can learn from one another. She really responded well to the Critical Experience Survey for Senior Leaders, the national grid case study, and the Integrated Succession Planning Toolkit. Specifically, she said that the critical role identification portion of the ISP would help her “quantify the leadership gaps” which is hugely important to her. The Critical experience survey would help formalize and quantify something she is doing informally now. Then I showed the research on agility vs. ability, aspiration and engagement and then tied that back into the ISP which she liked because it quantifies who your high potentials are- she gets how it works and said the tool is hugely valuable. When I questioned her and said that the tools overlap with some of the things she is already doing an adequate job of and are therefore not as valuable to her as she was saying they were she said she wants to re-do some of the things she has been doing like the critical role identification and the stretch role assignments in light of these tools (I realize this is odd because who would want to start over on a project they have already started on) but she said that the project is in its infancy and wouldn’t be hard to start over.",,"What did I show on FSI:

Next step would be to tie that performance management strategy to develop a Reward and Recognition Program.

Problem=She said leadership is not taking to performance management. Executives are not holding people accountable. Due to the industry of the business, a lot of Middle Management are Software people, who she explains are introverts and will avoid the confrontational nature of performance management conversations at all costs. 
Had a mid-year performance review required recently and made it as simple as “you just have to have a conversation” essentially to check the box of having a conversation surrounding performance management. Still had only a 35% engagement rate.
Terry’s boss says they don’t need performance ratings. Terry’s not sure what to do because they do need a performance management strategy in some capacity. She’s even considering taking away $ to hold leaders accountable. When she came on board they were running performance management out of an excel sheet. 
- Feels as though their HRIS system does not support their strategy surrounding matrix management. Tool does not support that and wants to work proactively through that.  (Not sure which tool they are using, will need to clarify)",,"I scheduled this POC a while back and before being trained on the EP offering and initially scheduled this with Maureen Cahill.

MCP: Attract and Retain Key Talent Needed to Fuel Growth and meet customer service goals

KI to focus on during call – EVP:
FirstEnergy is launching an EVP initiative following a large corporate re-organization. They are assembling a cross-functional team that is going to begin work in September. The project is expected to cover:

-	Collect data on “Voice of the Employee” – what do people value about working at FirstEnergy? What are areas of improvement?
-	Design an EVP using that data
-	Address gap areas identified as part of “voice of the customer” data collection

A parallel KI is D&I strategy execution (they are struggling to retain diverse talent) – while this won’t be the focus of the call, it would be very helpful to weave it into the EVP conversation.

Provide an extremely detailed plan for how we can help the customer with the EVP initiative.

They have already told us that they would like to pass on Gartner HR because they haven’t received a clear picture of how we would support them (I am covering this acct for another BD), to win, we will need to provide a very clear picture of what EVP support will look like.",,"Other topics of interest to the prospect are Succession, and Leadership Development",Christopher Long

•	They just did a employee engagement survey and the results showed that the number one area of opportunity for them to work on is career progression. 
•	They are centralizing their operations team to Austin.  Making most of their other workers remote.  So she expects changes from that, but not sure what. 
•	Corporate Goals: Speed through the line (get market presence as fast as possible), Drive operating excellence and scale Growth Work together to win 
o	HR contributes to growth by sourcing and recruiting talent to drive head count growth.  The challenge is keeping up with the people leaving.  So getting enough applicants 
o	Workforce strategy—contributes to operational effectiveness.  Didn’t dig into this too much. 
o	Attrition is what her CEO and Board talk to her about all the time.  The annual attrition is 43%, 28% is regrettable—goal is to get that down to 15%.

Who are the people that are leaving the org, a large number are HIPOs.  So, I asked if they had HIPO compencies defined and she said yes, but only on ability.  Showed her the 3 pilars of our HIPO model and that really resonated with her. She agrees.

Chris needs to improve time to fill, which leads to more revenue/profit for McAfee, while also increasing pipeline diversity. They went from having to have a diverse slate of candidates to now having to interview at least one diverse candidate for each position they are filling. Another question he is trying to answer, is “how do I communicate/make the case for what the future state of the TA function at McAfee should look like?”

We are trying to shift his perspective from CEB to Gartner. He remembers us as a website with benchmarking data. The more we can show him how we can help him not just validate his perspective on the problem, but also shift his thinking about the problem (“here are a few ways that executives/companies have gotten around your problem”) and communicate that internally ... the better. 

Caitlyn McDonough's plan for the call:
I would start with Ignition Diagnostic & RED, because with such a lean team it’s important to prioritize your strategy and diagnose what function practices might be hindering time to fill. 
From there it does sound like there’s an issue with staffing, so I’d share how we can help him assess the structure and make the case for additional staff (e.g., function benchmarks, Achieving Scale in Recruiting, Intuit/Beta cases). I might mention how we address some of the other root causes as well (e.g., hiring managers wanting to see more resumes for these new roles).

Succession Management:

Their C-Team had a retreat the week of 8/20 to discuss Succession. These succession discussions take place on a “regular basis” with the leadership team.

Their top priorities are identifying the right successors and tracking succession. They are not experiencing any turnover so they are faced with the “Clogged Pipeline” dilemma. They have had no turnover with their C-Team in 6 years and no turnover with their leadership team in about 4 years.
Because of this Clogged Pipeline, employees feel like they are not being developed.

This may be a good opportunity to highlight our capabilities when it comes to leadership development. She mentioned that leadership development goes hand in hand with succession at their organization.

Job Rotation:

We asked if they have ever considered implementing a Job Rotation program to deal with this Clogged Pipeline and that seemed to really resonate with her. A Job Rotation program sounds like something that they would be interested in implementing in the future.

Preparation:

I showed Michelle the Integrated Succession Planning Toolkit and walked through the “Critical Role Identification” and “HIPO Identification” tabs. She was very impressed with this tool.

Michelle would like to understand how her team would use our service to carry out initiatives like Succession Management and Leadership Development. We need to paint a vision on support over the first three months of membership.

Developing Enterprise Leaders for Digital Age

Creating a More Effective Leadership Development Strategy 

Reskilling the Workforce- What are those new skills and how do we develop them as automation increases?

More context from qualification calls:
1.	Leadership Development- We haven’t really done Leadership Development since 2008. We asked the business, 'what do you want in your leaders? Give us that criteria and we will build it' There is always this push and pull with the business.. Now that the business is transforming, Fintech, Digitalization,. business is more in need of HR and OD support. I am trying to figure out what we need in our leadership to support this new vision. Leadership Dev’t road map. Trying to create this. Just as a first start. Ask the leaders ""can you just weight these the capabilities you want to build."" 
2. Recent HR Strategy session with the business- Pulled together some of the senior BPs from the investor services group recently and were surprised the questions they now have for HR- We in HR have never created a strategy. We are completely reactive to the business. The business hasn't really defined that change yet. There are huge cultural boulders to actually operate in that kind of world..BBH is very hierarchical driven. Partner driver. Power, authority. Realize we have to work across boundaries. Decision making isn’t spread out. The person with the highest power wins. The HRBPs recognize that they need to drive, but they don’t know how. They just keep talking about agile.",,"Call is scheduled for 60 minutes on Thursday, September 20 at 2pm.

Sharing some of the newer research on communication best practices would likely be very interesting to him, in addition to benchmarking on comp/ben structures and process (this will help him make a case for change with the organization).",,"EY is moving to a new HCM system (SuccessFactors) globally.  Performance mgmt and core HR will go live in 2019, Compensation will go live in July 2020.  The top concern for Sean and EY is to develop a more globally consistent process and approach to compensation and benefits before this date.  They do not all have to have the same benefits globally, but they do need to follow the same process; same thing for compensation - they should get consistency around timing of pay reviews (what month, and how long does the process take).

**Please keep in mind that Sean works on the global team who develops systems/process, etc but given the “member firm” structure – the regional member firms do not have to comply with what global develops – therefore his role is largely an influencing role. With this said, external research and benchmarking is highly useful to drive decision-making.**
 
There are many other changes occuring (performance management philosophy, career frameworks, etc.) that also have an impact on compensation process and approach.

He has been working on a strategy, but it's still too undefined. He and his team have done a diagnosis of current culture with a local Argentine consultant, but he would like to do something broader/more strategic. 

He sees us as a potential partner in crafting his culture implementation strategy. He does not have success metrics nor a timeline for the culture change. I also remember that culture was something they were working on in fall 2016 before they dropped. They have clear pillars (innovation, creativity, collaborative work, openness to change) that need to make up the culture of ICBC, but installing these into the org is where he struggles. How do they first install these as part of the organizational culture, and then as part of everyone's day-to-day?  If we can make it clear how to implement culture change successfully and show him a clear timeline and metrics, I think that will convince him.

He considers his HR team to be change-capable. Broader org needs HR to help guide the change. Org is composed of 50% people that came to bank when they were still an American bank, then 25% from when they were Standard Bank, and the final 25% from being ICBC. How do they come up with unified culture in the midst of constant change and transformation for their industry?",Mainly showed Gustavo how we can support on his most important MCP - Culture.,"Gustavo speaks English, but prefers Spanish. If possible, please have a Spanish-speaking advisor for this POC.

He has his team making a BAT-like tool. I suggested BAT and he's interested, but he didn't seem keen on launching ours right away. Might be because our tool is more robust or because he's not trying to join HRL right away. I asked him if Nov 1 would be a realistic start date, he said yes. 

He cannot attend Reimagine, he will be in China. Wanted it to be in Spanish and I clarified it was not. He also wants us to be in Argentina, and that's how he sees success for us. While I told him we would not have that this year, I think he appreciates the personalized approach of HRL vs. CLC. 

In addition to culture, he is working on several other KIs, but culture is the main one. Here are the others: 
1. how to unify onboarding process (in Buenos AIres vs. in cities where new employees don't get to go to corporate)
2. improving employee experience
3. challenging org structure - implementing agile methodologies,",Keith Greene

In January we reorganized Sapient (a division of Publicis Groupe) as a single company and began the process of consolidating multiple brands into one, and shifting from a regional to an industry structure.  We also started a company-wide collaboration to define a new Purpose and Values, which I have led.  The Purpose is defined and we are using that to define Values in a series of global workshops culminating in a final decision at the end of October.  Our leadership council, a large advisory group of about 25 people, recently met in NY and agreed on a series of important shifts we need to make.  Overall, we are looking at a need for organizational change in multiple dimensions, at a company (like most probably) where these efforts have been challenged in the past.  Dimensions of change include:
•	New Purpose
•	New Values
•	New Strategy: From tech/experience capabilities to Digital Business Transformation services; towards specific propositions in each client industry
•	New Approach: towards wider adoption of agile principles and all the implications of doing with physically distributed teams
•	New Positioning: from Consulting and Marketing Services to Digital business transformation
•	Increased need for “Client Stewardship” from project-based relationships to strategic advisor

Leading change in a few of these dimensions is something we have done in the past.  But not this many dimensions at once.

Hope that helps and look forward to our discussion tomorrow.

I’ve included my notes from previous calls below, but to summarize, VIAVI has gone through a good amount of M&A activity/breaking off of different companies which has diluted the employee experience. She is looking to create a “shared culture” while also acknowledging/respecting cultures that already exist. She has a presentation with the CEO/CFO in November focused on creating corporate values. In December, she has a meeting with the CEO to discuss culture in general. She has complete buy-in from her CEO. She was essentially brought in to help with culture.

Ginger used us in the past through CEB and was a big fan. She is NOT the true SM, but is looking to move forward with purchasing a few seats. We made an emphasis on the enhanced advisory component through Gartner HR (compared to CEB). Her main hesitation is the fact that she felt the advisors through CEB didn’t get their hands dirty enough. She suggested they would provide her with actionable tools, and then when they’d pull back up with her, they’d ask  “How’d you do?!”. She is excited by the new model (Account Executive only supporting 25ish individuals) to allow for more of a “white-glove” approach of support.",,Their CEO is completely bought in on culture.

10/11/18 - Kerry sent us an email saying she is going through budgetting and wanted to have a sense of pricing. WE asked for 5 minutes to share good news and then ended up having a full call. We identified that L&D/Leadership Development are top of mind. She is looking to establish a strong structure/framework for talent development. The company is 23 years old and has never done anything like that. Went through RED as well to show how we take work off of her plate. Told her we would send over some additional collateral. Quickly discussed MSWS and liked the idea of it. Need to send over HBR, Painless Performance Conversations training, and get L&D/Leadership Development advisor on the call on 10/16. 10/10/18 - FSI - We are currently working w/ Pzena Invesmtents through GTS ($90k). She was aware of that relatinoship. She is a 2 person team. She took time to highlight Kis she is focused on from the t-up. She said career pathing, assessing HR function, assessing training needs, HR technology selection and scaling HR. She is looking to get from 40B to 100B in revenue in 5-7 years. Metrics have not been clearly defined. She said she tracks all of the things in the middle (MCP levers) but isn't being held accountable to move any of htem to a certain percentage. She said the biggest piece for her is setting a strategy for her department. She is spread thin and ""day to day activities get in the way of strategy"". I went through Ignition and she liked it a lot. Brought her on to portal to show Ignition Guides. Did a little more diagnosis and she said Manager development/L&D are top of mind. Need to determine timelines. Told her we would set up another call w/ an Advisor to demonstrate how it comes to life.",George Penn

Job Architecture- specifically around jobs and job titling. What we have done in the past has been very laissez fair about job titles. For instance, VP of Marketing. We don’t have a standard definition for that. This has become somewhat haphazard for us. Trying to move away from just calling someone a VP or SVP…we want to give you the right title for what you are actually doing. People here can’t describe what they actually do.

•	1500-2000 FTEs
•	Introduced new career framework – using traditional Towers grading structure

o	Identified 500 unique jobs 
o	Trying to communicate architecture to employee base / moving org to an understanding of what a job is, why we should use business titles
o	Titles don’t describe what the job does. Typically have described it by hierarchy in the organization. Now want to describe it by functional responsibilities 
o	Have hybrid jobs – becomes difficult to describe in 30 characters 
o	May have three different kinds of bps. How to describe those? Senior HRBP and lead, group manager, etc?
o	Build out job library 
o	Have unique jobs being a basketball association
o	Getting business titles, nomenclature correct

We have been placed in the budget and this POC should hopefully help secure the deal with this client. Susan is a first-time head of HR at a growing canadian tech company.

Her key focus right now at Kichler is evaluating their organizaiton's business model. We set the expectation that we cannot provide insight into other functions (i.e. how should a sales function be set up) as that is part the sales partnership - but she is curious to understand what are the capabilities and extent of support we can provide for Org Design.

Attached you will see the screen shot i grabbed from when he talked through his strategy.  He knows the importance of having a strong HR function. While talking through his strategy, he prioritized two pieces: 
1. Learning & Development and 2. Employee Engagement - his number one goal and focus is to help to grow their talent.

•	With previous larger organization experience at Service Master & PepsiCo – need a succession planning process that isn’t overly complicated and cumbersome

•	Implementing a cohesive culture as people don’t necessarily aspire to work in a food plant (identifying and enhancing the drivers of retention outside of comp&ben)

1.	By 2019 Q1, deliverables include a framework for the succession planning process, deliverable to the C-suite & Board members

-	They have used Skype in the office a lot and are trying to do more around that.
-	People there aren’t very used to training not being available in person and they need to wean them off of that since they have offices across the country.

i had a FSI with both of them, and they wanted to have a more in-depth conversation around their priorities to see how GHR could be immediately applicable. see their priorities below:

Robin (L&D):
let’s focus on the Approach to Developing 1st Time Leaders.  Some background that may help you in preparing the demo:
Currently, we have a program for new/1st time leaders that consists of a two separate/distinct components – ‘Compliance’ and ‘Enrichment’.   Compliance is as you would expect the title to mean, and leaders are expected to attend within first 6 months of their new role – focuses on policies/other requirements.  Enrichment is more the leadership fundamentals. 
2019 – we are taking a hard look at the current program approach and offerings to enhance and expand the program, to make it more of a continuum of timely and relevant learning and development over a specified period of time, with new format and content.  We want to create a modularized approach that will enable us to pull out certain components and offer through an open registration/enrollment process.

April (D&I):

She refers to this as “Submarine Leadership.” The submarine can be steered, and everything is handled by the people that are on it – having the right people in place, they understand their role, they understand their work, and they are empowered to make decisions. In order to establish this empowerment culture, NN needs to have better transparency and very clear communication.
The business has grown through a number of acquisitions of smaller companies that complimented or supplemented the existing business of NN. As a result of all of these acquisitions, they have a lot of micro cultures. There seems to be a sort of anxiety and/or nervousness of not knowing how to work with a larger organization like NN. Or there is this perception that there is this larger organization that is over them and is going to get in the way of how they do work.
NN has an aging workforce – people have been w/ the company for 20 years, a lot were privately owned before their acquisition – which meant everything was dictated from the top. 
When a company is acquired by NN, the culture is shifted – What’s in it for these employees to change now?
Leadership:
Toqeer is working on some skills based coaching and development w/ the leadership team
The leadership team has been part of creating a vision of culture – Identifying the type of culture NN wants and the type of place they want to be
The CEO is bought in on the culture model. 
100% of the leadership team understands the model, but not everyone on the leadership team supports it or completely believes in it - the feeling is that there’s not enough bench strength in talent yet to be able to empower individuals. 
Employees have never been managed that way in the past - there is some concern if employees will assume empowerment if given it
The next step is fostering and developing some higher leadership and coaching skills – they need to model the performance and behaviors of the org",,Timelines and Milestones,George Penn

About a week after joining, Imperva announced that they will no longer remain public and an offer was made by PE firm Thoma Bravo, however they will continue operating under current leadership. The go-shop period for the transaction ends this week (11/26) and the acquisition will be made official. 

We've had multiple conversations with the Key 2nd, Jim Welch, who oversee's recruiting and have held an initial introductory 1+ hour long conversation with JC at the beginning of November. It has been a few weeks since we spoke with JC and he should have a better understanding of the companies priorities going into 2019. We'd like to use this call to diagnose more around the strategy and role HR/Recruting will have and also show how we've partnered with other organizations as they go through the changes of Public to Private PE-owned.

He has worked with McKinsey which gave a lot of ratio data but he doesn’t think it was effective because it was pure numbers and didn’t give context for the HR needs.  While focusing on efficiency it's an imperative that HR doesn’t ""drop the ball"". They are very successful and always on ""great places to work"" so it's important to keep quality up.

He's  interested in partnership with Gartner because he realizes he needs external support ""to keep from being insular"" in his approach during the transformation.

1. Building an analytics strategy to use data in strategy
2.

The Head of Talent Acquisition (Janet Gispon) just started mid-November and is an internal hire with no T.A. experience.  DISH's biggest area of opportunity right now is within their recruiting practices. They have 2 core issues. 
Issue #1:
They run a high-volume call center & in-home technician recruiting program
Ineffectively using technology & assessments
Getting close to 300,000 through the process a year and hires at a ratio that is way smaller than he should be hiring
Turning at close to 100% in some of those roles
• I am attracting wrong people (top of funnel)
• Processes are inefficient
• People that I’m hiring don’t stay
Issue #2
2nd problem is more theoretical
I’m a paid TV company that’s trying to attract 5G wireless professionals. There is a brand attractions, workplace, comp/ben discussion that needs to happen. How do I attract top talent that’s in line with our culture when these people don’t want to join an outdated company?",,"*** The only time that Dave could meet the remainder of the year is December 18th from 2:30-3:30pm MT.

Other notes from previous calls:
• We are in final decision making cycle on moving to cloud-based HCM. A big part of my job is refining, improving, and modernizing HR practices in preparation for technology switch. This is going to be an all-encompassing project for 2019 and into 2020.
• Improving core business lines – satellite, paid, sling – solidifying and growing both sides of this business
• 2019/2020 – wireless business (upcoming work dish has been investing in) will be coming to fruition. Big deadline March 2020.
• We pulled up the TelCo visual and Dave really liked it
• “Dish isn’t fancy. I was brought into a 38 year old HR and modernize them”
• TA Lead, L&D Lead, Employee Experience Leader (Comp, ben, HRIS, HCM conversion, D&I – back off day-to-day HR… hasn’t had a lot of luck finding someone to fill this role and has been looking for 180 days), 2 generalists that direct report to him (someone that operates field and someone that operates corporate)
o Has teams in each area that are good but not seasoned
• We have a “one size fits all” mentality on the workforce right now. We need to change our talent perspective as we move to this cloud format. 
3 things that make this a complex discussion:
• Cost is always a challenge for us – “spend the companies money like it’s our own” – we’re always resource constrained
• I want to know what the current relationships are to see if we’re getting the ROI.

Franklin Templeton Topics
During my conversation w/ Mary Leahy, she mentioned that her #1 priority right now is accelerating the Global Client Partnering team which she now oversees. She asked what we have on HRBPs specifically. She feels this team has been doing great work but leadership was lacking, they get wrapped up in their day to day, and haven't been able to accelerate the vision of the organization.

Current State: 
The only thing we do currently from an onboarding perspective is 3-day session in San Jose called “Seven Start” onboarding. We take them through One team behaviors, leadership principles, teach them about innovation. Basically just an introduction. The only place we do that is San Jose. For employees outside of San Jose office, Talent Acquisition person picks the new hire up on their first day and hands them off to the manager. Managers are wildly inconsistent with their onboarding approaches. 

What would would they like to change/get done?
I would like to hand managers a playbook for how to help them onboard. Give managers a plan to improve their capabilities. Huge workstream we are working on to get this right. Wyatt has been pushing leadership to scale onboarding globally. Don’t need to be in-person, but need some type of standardized approach in offices outside of San Jose. How do we solve week 1? What do managers need to be thinking about month 1, 3,  and 6? I want to have an onboarding framework for each person at the company. 

Who is working on this? Hired someone recently to work on these onboarding challenges (brought her over from other part of the business). I am telling her to talk to some of her peers about what they are doing, but would love to see how you guys could help us on this. 

Measurements: Time to productivity. How do we get that from 12 to 9, 8, 7 months? How do we measure success in this area?

Now that we have chosen Learn Lead Succeed we need to help  employees operationalize the culture by understanding what are the behaviors that allow them to embody the culture (our work on how to operationalize from Pitney Bowes and Bill and Melinda Gates is good here) 2) We want to get an ""outside"" view on EVP and understand how our EVP compares. 3) Metrics- we want to select the right metrics and improve data quality ""garbage in, garbage out"" 4) Recruiting this is the item under my umbrella that the higher-ups (i.e. Nikita) cares about the most, we have too many open positions and the labor market is tight. 


Original:
What support Gartner can provide from a recruiting perspective. Specifically, Pamela has to get a presentation ready for the middle of January where she presents the recruiting metrics she has selected and what her recruiting strategy will be for 2019. That's her main milestone and MCP is filling a large amount of open positions. Secondary initiatives are around culture. They have selected the cultural values of ""Learn, Lead, Succeed"" but now need help showing employees how to operationalize those values (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation case study resonated). Third phase of the culture initiative is understanding what are the performance competencies that they can derive from ""Learn lead succeed"" and how in general, are performance competencies related to the organizational values.",,My manager suggested Chris Long- not sure if he is available.

Notes:
•	Nandita is Head of Talent Acquisition for Americas.  She reports into Miriam Ort (SVP HR Americas) and Miriam reports into CHRO (Ned Linnen)
•	Started at Avis Budget in Oct. 2018.  Had CEB CLC exposure @ Infosys.  Mainly through downloading items from website but remembered Ignition guides in particular
•	EVP and setting up employee referral program (they don’t have one) are at the top of the list
•	Have set up a cross functional team to address EVP – included Talent Acquisition, Comp/Ben, and Communications
•	Have collected data – was very hard for them to do.  Tried to look at key talent segments and employee sentiment but hard to get data.  They did it all inhouse without any external support.  Nandita thinks they didn’t do a good job of getting data to inform redesign process.
•	Came up w/ couple themes – attributes they think they are strong. Collaborative, friendly atmosphere, family values atmosphere, flexible hours, culture etc. great peers collegiate environment.  Not playing up rewards/comp.  not their strength.  
•	Now moving into Design phase – this is where they need help.
•	Wants to do a POC.  Thinks additional employee sentiment data would be helpful input.  Wants to understand how we would work with them to do redesign process.  Wants to include 2 colleagues in UK that are on the comm side: Steven Knight and Simon Robinson.",Anna Krasniewska

4.	Learning Platform Review (considering Workday Learning and Degreed) – this will likely need to be tackled in a separate Analyst call if we get to that, for now we just want an Advisor on the first two bullets

Full Notes from Call, January 7, 2019 with Kathy Vizachero, TRowe Price
TRowe Price – currently holds a Corporate Leadership Council membership but has nothing specific to Learning & Development.  We are speaking with Kathy Vizachero – Head of Executive Leadership Development and Learning: She has a background in learning space, talent mobility, competencies, etc.  Joined TRowe Price in Nov 2017.  
She is metrics focused and is familiar with the Kirkpatrick Model (4 Levels of Training Evaluation) and previously used Metrics That Matter at a previous organization.  We (CEB/Gartner) sent TRowe Price a proposal for Metrics That Matter a while back, but she could not justify cost even though she sees the value in MTM.  
Leadership Development & Metrics
2019 Focus is on Leadership Development
•	They have many offerings today but no systemic roadmap
•	Never sustained a leadership core curriculum
•	Need to develop a curriculum  
They’ve done some work to see the progression and steps but still need to develop a curriculum.
TRowe Price is currently using a Dashboard to track about 20 metrics, but Kathy mentioned that they are NOT working closely with the business to identify and use their metrics.",George Penn

Nick (talent analytics lead) did not join the call

	Michele wanted to focus on HR structure & strategy instead
	Started with 3 key differentiators for improving HR efficiency: governance, process standardization, and automation. Used to transition to Ignition Diagnostic
	Walked through Ignition Diag. found Diagnostic outputs valuable, would use results to defend/validate decisions about where she is spending her time & resources.


Priorities:
Talent Analytics: 
	Recruiting ‘quota-carrying employee’ dashboard: # of open recs, talent sources, attrition numbers
o	Have huge numbers of employees not making it past first year. Trying to look at onboarding, development, and quality of hire
	Hired 107 sales employees, lost 57 before first year
o	Need to get leaders to make decisions based on deliverables like this dashboard – why are they not using and applying the data Michele’s team is providing them?

HR Structure & Efficiency:
	Always need to justify spend & functional priorities to CEO, CFO, and business leaders
	Need better HR process standardization globally – e.g. with India BU","The call is scheduled for this Thursday, Jan 24 at 2pm EST. Please let know if anyone on the team is able to join this call.",Elisabeth Joyce

Also, from an outcome perspective, for us this is about improving time to productivity but also employee retention.

This client has CLC only and I have uncovered many needs that fall into L&D specifically for Maria Van Brown and have been trying to add a seat for her.  WellCare has added one advisor seat but did not name Maria as the license holder.  I want to use this call to show Maria the value in adding a seat for herself.  Some of her questions are covered in CLC but HRL/L&D will be able to go much deeper to support her request.  Here is Maria's specific request that I sent in as an inbound and was told the majority of what she needs falls outside of CLC:

Hi Victoria- I’m not sure if you can help me here, but I am interested in working with a Gartner advisor on optimizing WellCare’s L&D organization. We currently have about 128 associates (97 full time) supporting our organization of about 12,800 W-2s and 20,000 1099s.  We also have a smaller team of 11 dedicated to succession and leadership development.

I am looking to discuss options for a different operating model including a new org structure(s), and outsourcing some different capabilities. I’ve reviewed much of the research but really looking for a custom approach, leveraging different options that other companies employ.

I did send through a few items already from CLC and two gifts from ""L&D/HRL"".  I will prep with the advisor before the call to discuss what has been shared. I also have a copy of the HR priorities and a lot of insight into what Maria owns aside from this inbound. 

The client has a lot of resources to leverage.  They recently bought Bersin and ExecOnline.  they also have Talent Neuron, CLC and one Advisor seat.  I have been working to get Maria a seat for a year now, so i really want to help Maria understand the difference of CLC and a HRL seat and this is a great way to do so.",,The client is on edge right now in fully understanding what HRL entails. I have been convincing the CHRO that Maria needs to seat b/c what she owns is not supported in CLC but the CHRO will not allocate the dollars to her and I think this is the opportunity to do so.,Anna Krasniewska

They are focusing on these four main buckets: 1. Reboot Performance Management System, 2. Redesign Total Rewards, 3. Evolve L&D Programs, 4. Improve Succession Planning. For the purpose of this call, we’ll be diving deep into redesigning the Total Rewards front – the VP of Total Rewards, Justen Moore, and the VP of HR, Jason Gorham, will be on the line. They are looking to evolve their compensation, benefits and wellness packages. They need to get a better understanding of the current needs in the marketplace to attract and recruit top talent to remain competitive in the marketplace. They are also looking to improve the overall employee experience because right now, they feel that their employees are feeling the pain from all of the change they’ve endured as a company. There is no formality or consistency across the Total Rewards front – they only manage compensation from the US and Canada, which has caused a lot of issues, so they would like to make this a global practice. In order to effectively revamp TR, they know they’ll need to do some job leveling as well – needs best practices and help there. They are also focusing a lot of effort in their Performance Management system, which ties to the total rewards, because pay for performance is on the roadmap. On this call, they’d like to see best practices, tools, insights and ideas of how we would work together to support them on the TR front.

•	Have had conversations going back to November/December re HR priorities over next 5 years – performance, succession, L&D, TR. Justin hasn’t participated in those calls, yet. Want to see what opportunities might be in TR 
•	Justin has been with Leggett for a total of 12 years – left and came back (went to Walmart, Tyson) 
•	Leggett is fragmented re comp – big company but acts small (to our own detriment). As we’ve expanded globally, lack processes/structure where we should have it 
•	Justen – started in role September 2019
o	Didn’t have comp philosophy
o	Comp team was very transactional 
o	US population is 10k employees, 2500 are exempt positions
o	He put together a plan – how do we want to position ourselves. Have a loose sign off on targeting median. For year 1 – back to basics, only going to look at corporate, salaried positions – those are the jobs we know the best, want to get a feel for, from a pricing perspective, how close are we to median pay. Was thinking about putting together a home grown evaluation toolkit but looking at what’s available from consultant POV to speed up the process 
o	Will get in to bonus, LTI
o	Benefits in year two 
o	Classifying all jobs into families and functions at the moment for SAP implementation 
•	AP walked through IG for job leveling, benefits comms research overview","Organizational Context
Leggett & Platt is going through a lot of change. They just completed the biggest acquisition they’ve ever undertaken by multiples and they have a lot of senior level transitions that are happening. There is a completely brand new c-suite and they are hiring an external CFO, which they haven’t done in 40 years. They just created their 2019-2023 strategy and they finally have the talent and capital to act on it. It’s broken into 4 different buckets: 1. Reboot Performance Management System, 2. Redesign Total Rewards, 3. Evolve L&D Programs, 4. Improve Succession Planning.  

History of L&P HR
Executives didn’t know better and didn’t think of them as a strategic partner. The former CHRO trained the business to think of them as tactical and in the past they have been seen as “ticket taking.” This is their 3rd or 4th attempt to modernize HR programs/approach.

What preparation is required?	Julie wants to use this time to dive deep into talent reviews processes and succession planning. She would like to see how other companies have facilitated an effective talent review that feeds a more formalized succession planning process. She wants to understand things like: How do we setup the processes? How do we make sure we have executive leader buy-in that don’t think they need to go through something more formal?
Also, Julie would be interested in a recommendation around how deep they should go. All executive population = 1,200 at Director and above. Right now, she is thinking around 200-300 people, but is open to a recommendation. She thinks there’s about 50-75 real high flyers and successors to 12-36 months, but would like to get better insight from an advisor on recommendations for creating and conducting this process. They really want visibility to create some mobility or opportunity that puts their employees on a path toward the future. Eventually, she would like to drop down into the real HIPOs.

make this meeting successful?	Organization Context: 
They have been a entrepreneurial, founder-led company for the vast majority of their existence. Niall Patterson, founder and CEO, passed away 1.5 years ago so Brent Schaefer came on board about 1 year ago – they are working through the transition of having a founder-led entrepreneur at the helm to a new style of CEO.
Brent is coming in from a different environment, wants different-level (increased) formality. They are dealing with the generation maturation and lots of wealth accumulation in senior roles – these people will be retiring soon, so they need help conducting talent reviews in order to prepare and recruit the right talent to lead the organization.
They are trying to break out from the organic level of succession planning/succession management.
They’ve done a few things to add formality … people there feel like it’s an HR process vs. being a business process. They want it to feel more validated, valued, etc. so that people will participate.
They need this to create a sustainable pipeline so they have the portfolio of skills/experiences they need to be successful. They need help building a structure they can adapt. 

What They’ve Done & Want To Do 
One thing they’ve done … they’ve put a stake in the sand. They do their executive appraisals in the first quarter … getting ready to start & will conclude in March. They embed promotion decisions with the process in the past, but now they’re moving things around under new leaders and are making adjustments … pushing out executive promotions into May and will do this in conjunction with a talent review/process that they want to run. This is around executive talent. 
They’ve done variations of succession planning before and have done a handful different approaches over the years. They just had a decent conversation about it … looking at SVPs with their executive committee. It wasn’t one where it was formal. They did 9-box-ish k",Christopher Long

Personal pain and value and business value

How we can help Meike impact her role within the first 100 days in role 
Meike is from a Strategy background and sits on the board - she has taken on the CHRO role, because they know to implement their strong 22 strategy successfully, the emphasis on the people agenda and impact, therefore there is a big focus on HR strategy vs business strategy alignment. 

Describes the challenge as 2 fold: 

Back end (operational HR ""so we are running like a machine"")
Strategic --> starting with implementing the basics (following company wide digital transformation)
Wants to align HR strategy to the business strategy and review on 2 year and 5 year basis (ignition diagnostic really good for this, and how we can sense check year or year or 2 years, 5 years and course correct where necessary etc)

She said anything to help her with her transition into the role and make a fast start and IMPACT straight away would be useful.

They are a people organisation but they processes are dated and traditional and they are building the new Talent Management process in a digital way from Talent Acquisition, Career Development, Training and Leadership from scratch BUT they want to adopt best practice - they want to do what the best companies do.

Advisor to describe how they will partner will Meike specifically to be successful in her first year as a CHRO and make tangible impact through tailored partnership and contextualise best practice from strategy all the way to execution. 

Business value and personal value --> and personal PAIN as this is her first time in the CHRO role.","CHRO portal, board support, resources for new CHRO's (which she is), dove into Strategic Planning IG briefly, showed SP template, Strategy on a Page, quick talk through of Ig Diagnostic and BAT.","This is a top opportunity

1. With a very lean HR department, how can the HR team support the business in the agile work environment transformation?
2. What competencies do they need to support their engineers?
3. How should we think about career pathing & planning, performance management, compensation & benefits in an agile work environment?

Peter and I had hypothesized that we would be focusing on HR strategy and employee performance management, but had to shift that agenda. Instead, we focused on the career pathing and planning needs of agile teams. To illustrate those points, I showed them the Intel case study from ILC/CIO (which aligns to the ILM KI and should totally be on the GHRL website). I also wove in a conversation  about the competencies that drive digital dexterity as well as a brief foray into Cigna to discuss the TR implications of agile (also, her comp mgr was on the phone and I didn't want her to feel left out).

Before partnering with a third party vendor, they were going to undergo a market analysis project to understand how their offerings compare to other organizations, industry trends, etc. But, because they are looking to transform and evolve, doing market analysis now doesn't make since because it's not what they want to offer. Because of this, they are looking to partner with Gartner (exploring other options as well) to help them with career pathing, PM support, building competencies, etc. to evolve as an organization. Right now their retention is great, but they want to understand how they can keep employees there as they evolve or how they allow for the right amount of attrition if that person isn't a good fit.",Keith Greene

The conversation will be focused around culture. Cleveland Cliffs is building a new operation and will be hiring 130 new employees in a new geographic location. This has given them pause to think more about culture--what is our culture? what do we want to build? how do we create the right culture at this new operation? He is interested in understanding thoughts and experiences around culture piece.  Some of his specific questions include:
1. how do we define culture? (he said if he asked 10 people in corporate senior roles to define culture he would get 10 different answers)... ""we have solid core values, but not culture""
2.  how do we compare to what best cultures look like? 
3. do we want the same culture in new operation as we have today or is this an opportunity to instill new values?
4. how do we reinforce culture?","Prep Notes attached.  Notes from call below.
- Flat organisation, not open to offsite/big discussion re culture and values
- No burning desire for change, as good culture now so hard to get buy-in for initiative
- Starting new plant, key goal is to fill those positions with good people, success of plant critical to success in new market.
- Discussed both Culture and EVP (in thinking about how to attract critical talent EVP most relevant for success of goal but he seemed more drawn to the culture element).
- liked the Ignition Guide > as can be light touch
- PayPal > interesting but would have to be implemented carefully to work 
- EVP didn't resonate with him, as feels different org with basic attraction due to location and good benefits package, tried to push branding angle from that > package up whats successful to attract new recruits to plant, plus consider differentiation in new location/skills needed.
- pushback around types of companies profiled, although told extractable insights.
- very personable.",we can plan to prep ahead of POC and I'll share additional detail Thanks!,Justine van Huyssteen

CEO and CHRO are prioritising for HR to improve on is Leadership Development. 
Client says biggest barrier is that leaders are pulled out of their programs (that they are nominated by their managers for), to prioritise client accounts and requests --> so they are unable to actually execute on the programs. 
This ties into their MCP struggle of silo working across the organisation (managers prioritising their own needs). 
His personal goal is to break down silos in the organisation - starting with HR - silo working is a big problem in HR and he thinks HR should set an example for the rest of the organisation, wants to drive consensus and build a structure in the HR team and across the broader organisation.
I demonstrated how Ignition Diagnostic/Instant IG would help - really liked this, lots of questions around delivery. Understands this would be a good starting point.

Some candidates are cautious about their industry.

Recruiting Structure: What are the best predictors of success between sharing the function between and RPO and in-house staff?

We need to do a Global review of overall recruiting structure. 
We want to create a customer-obsessed lateral recruitment model. 
Enhanced employment branding and CX is needed. 
Onboarding…how do we create a Client-obsessed model?

He is presenting the idea to his leadership team May 9th and is hoping a Promotion Task Force will come out of the meeting.

Received 5/1 after my call with Jamie:
My expectations would be a quick, high-level overview of the recruiting data available (no need to go into the IBP). The advisor vouching for the data that’s available will hold more credibility than me.  From there we can to pivot into how she can leverage the data she is already collecting through workday. She mentioned they are not utilizing the data and therefore not optimizing the technology they have already invested a ton of money into. I think that will be a great display of the value we add.
 
Computer Aid’s president spends $100K for his own development and is a big proponent of Gartner and for her and the HR team getting access to the HR resources so the ball is already in our court.
 
Received 4/30:
The prospect wants  to review the overall recruiting data/benchmarks we have available and understand what might also be applicable for her staffing function (time to fill, cost per hire, branding, diversity, sourcing pipeline, onboarding, etc.). She now wants to also understand how we recommend she leverage some of the data they do have from Workday.
 
From the prospect: 
I’d be interested to revisit the overall corporate recruiting data on what can transfer over.  We are able to track turnover in Workday but we are not currently leveraging the metric, so I would be interested to learn about how Gartner recommends that turnover stats be used.
 
Received 4/22:
She wants to benchmark their recruiting function against peers in the technology industry as well as against their staffing arm of the business. Are we in line with what is happening in the industry? Where are their biggest areas of improvement? She is looking for data on time to fill, cost per hire, turnover, first year attrition, etc. How the tool works will not be in question, rather they kinds of data that can be gathered from the tool. 
 
If the advisor could help me further diagnose what she is looking for that may be of value as well.","Business challenges - application software space, highly competitive, hardest to fill positions.  Works to fill: internal team, staff augmentation team and project teams.  If focused on accessing data to compare them to other like organizations - shifted the conversation to talk about how to articulate value of the function.  Data is not going to be cut to the degree she wants, however, there is a lot of data that would work for her dashboard, business case for recruiting value.  Also talked about how to use this data to drive improvements across the recruiting space.","The client would like to see what kinds of benchmarking data for recruiting are available within the Interactive Benchmarking Platform. I walked through some of the reports but don’t know how to navigate the platform. She is looking for IT specifically. I need someone who is an expert in using the UBP.

She wants to benchmark their recruiting function against peers in the technology industry as well as against their staffing arm of the business. Are we in line with what is happening in the industry? Where are their biggest areas of improvement?

If the advisor could help me further diagnose what she is looking for that may be of value as well. 

I was trying to steer her in the direction of using the Recruiting Effectiveness Diagnostic and the Departure View so she can understand what is happening in their organization as a place to start. She mentioned that those are mentioned they weren’t tracking anything around candidate experience and haven’t started measuring turnover yet.


I recommended she look at the recruiting effectiveness diagnostic and Departure view surveys to benchmark the organization against others.  I also gave an overview on TalentNeuron for labor market data (TTF, Salary expectations, Skill requirements, supply & demand etc.)

They do managed services and staff augmentation.

Half of Deb’s role is corporate recruiting for Computer Aid Inc. The other part of her role is staffing. She wants to be able to use data for both.

She mentioned that everything I showed aligns with what she would be looking for from a corporate perspective but not sure how she would utilize from a staffing perspective",Anna Krasniewska

Hi Team,

Greer is a reference seatholder looking to potentially move to an Advisor seat, so I wanted to provide her with this interaction to determine  if this is something she would be a good fit for.

While this would be a document review of her training strategy, she also wants to inform and improve it given her and the TL (Denise CHRO) will be leading module 1 and 4. An outside facilitator with do 2 & 3.

Notes:
Training Format: 4 Modules for HRBPs at the SBU's
	- 1st module: educating on HR manager versus HR BP - why you want to be a business partner
	- I actually pulled a presentation that talked about HR as a business partner to the line and getting them on the same page from Gartner.
	- 4th module: employee engagement what it looks like and using analytics
		â Employee engagement: We are just trying to see where they are at and help them see the bigger picture. They are so transactional. We really need to assess them and their skills and where are they are at but also educate and develop them for them to understand they have a much bigger involvement in the big picture.
		â Analytics: Big Denise push - she is familiar using analytics for engagement and driving forward looking plan
		â Greer: learning area for me. We have metrics, but different than analytics. 
			Â§ It will be basic: what analytics are, how you to utilize for employee engagement

Goal: Grow on this training and not end there.
	- Other 2 have a facilitator - AAP vendor or another person
	- 1st or 4th - Denise and Greer to deliver - it will be both of them.
	- Timeline: Launching late June early July at the offsite meeting

Total people: between 4-15, finalizing the group - more of a junior staff",,"MODULE 4:

Why:
	Employee engagement-what does that look like?  
	Using Analytics to create a baseline.
What:
	Discuss criteria for defining employee engagement 
	Review supporting HR analytics to create a baseline.
Facilitator:
	TBD

We did a POC with them on Culture with Sasha in January but the team has changed and Larry will be the only person who was on the original conversation. The focus of that POC was assessing & managing the culture. 

This meeting will most likely be on driving a high performance culture through leaders. they have replaced their entire leadership bench and are looking at how their managers can be more effective in driving performance. Also measuring and improving employee engagement. 


Manager Development:
Create strategy to develop leadership skills in frontline managers -- many people managers are promoted based on high performance as a salesperson but dont have leadership skills. 
Rebuild leadership bench --- the majority of senior leadership has turned over and have new leadership in role
Create buy vs. build strategy (internal vs. external skills)

Thank you!","I opened with the most L&D-centric research that we have on supporting digital transformation (Nationwide). From there, Rob mentioned that his two biggest priorities are how to develop scrum masters and product owners internally and how to adapt performance management to the needs of agile teams. Now, we can answer those questions -- and it sounds like we'll need to in order to meet Rob's high standards (former GE guy). But, the challenge for us is that this stuff lives on Gartner.com, not GHRL. I can probably kluge something together on the PM space, but it's frustrating/challenging to know that we can answer his questions, but aren't permitted to share the right resources with him. More research required!","The prospect is open on July 16 anytime outside of 10-11am ET. Please see below for Brent's email confirming he would like to join the call.

They were networking in Tennessee to understand what other organizations and hospitals are doing in terms of D&I within and one of our clients introduced us. Methodist is the adult hospital and Le Bonheur is the children’s hospital. They are focused on delivering high quality, safe outcomes for patients and families. Their culture and values are the framework for how they treat patients. They are very centered on creating an environment where associates can bring their A game to work and deliver that A game service to patients. From an HR standpoint, they spent the last several years being very focused and intentional about driving the right culture. It’s been a journey, made significant strides and have a very engaged workforce (has been on the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For List many times). Always looking for how they can get better and be more effective.

Especially on that last point I believe there is room to show some of our leader survey tools, such as the critical experience survey for senior leaders to show how we would work with the leaders he currently has in place to identify which expereinces were most valuable to their own development.

Kelly (VP of HR) is new to the role and her most important priority is to transform the organization’s perception of HR – she wants to transform it from reactive to proactive 
-	The organization as a whole doesn’t have much strategic direction; their strategic plan is more focused on Sales Growth given their industry (they are an engineering and architectural planning company)
-	She has a lot of experience at larger corporations, but she wants to transform the way the workforce and business leaders sees HR so that they can begin to shift to more strategic processes 
-	She feels very overwhelmed and needs help assessing what will be the most impactful things for us to drive forward this vision and what the business needs from HR 
-	Pre-call with BDM

Current Progress:

•	As it relates to customer centricity vision/mission – also delivering through independent retail channels, and want to hone in on experimental solutions (contract needs paint but also might have other challenges/complexities that they could attend to beyond products).
o	Started with internal folks on listening to VOC to identify pain points, opportunities, and how to get creative in solutioning
o	Formal learning tends to not resonate
•	The most critical thing that they need to focus on is “thinking outside the box – mobilizing thoughtfully but expeditiously against opportunities – balancing innovation with maintenance”
o	Challenge is new way of thinking, mobilizing cross-functional teams
o	What will keep CEO up at night? Whether or not they have effectively gotten leaders (seniormost or next level down) engaged and accountable to support this effort.   Can’t do it with just 1 person.  Have to mobilize the VPs/Officers/Advisors (~80 people).
	For this year, need to figure out the lens through which they will measure leaders (directors +) from the rest of the org.  If they don’t Put money where their mouth is in a consistent way, then they don’t stand a chance.  Need consistency and similar accountabilities. 
	No silver bullet – batted around a few ideas.  This is the most urgent.
	Have not defined or articulate what it means to be a leader at BMC  - and that’s a problem.  Resisting urge to go down competency path.  Want to start with something more consumable and more basic.  
•	Struggle to attract talent for a number of reasons – hot market + what they need for short/near/long term
•	Believes in the value inherent in the partnership; Just spoke with Jeannie – doesn’t know if everyone is getting the same level of value as Keri.  Wants to see team getting more value out of it. Asked Jeannie to see if people are using it.  Is it the same usual suspects?

We’re working with a government organisation who are embarking on a culture transformation to ensure employees and leaders display behaviours’ that drive high performance to help meet their ambitious growth objectives. 
•	Pain of getting it wrong
They were investing heavily in people-focused culture initiatives designed to do two things (1) generate buy-in for the desired culture within the organisation and (2) find new employees who fit the culture they needed. Unfortunately, Gartner’s latest research suggests that whilst organisations invest approximately $2900 per employee per year on related culture initiatives, only 31% of organisations have the culture they need to drive future business performance. 
•	How we helped
We worked with HR leadership to implement a process-focused culture strategy shown to drive employee performance by up to 22% and performance against revenue goals by up to 9%. This involved: surfacing ongoing culture intelligence, equipping employees to  apply culture in their day-to-day work and expanding leader role modelling to break down process barriers",Aaron McEwan

Short Term - How do we build the competence required for the future now, how are other companies looking to address this in a fast way, what are the methods they're looking to take. This is more focused on things that are currently missing in what people should be doing now. 
Longer Term - Create a different generation of competence for a longer term need. Talent this is going to enable them to meet the future objectives of the organisations.

This change often leaves a dramatic competence gap, which can often not be compensated or only with considerable delay. Internal potential candidates are often not sufficiently available or unwilling to take the new job. It is also not easy to hire candidates externally to fill the gap. In addition, this is often associated with high costs and – which is even more important - the new employee is only sufficiently productive after 9 to 12 months. Our managers and executives are afraid of these performance gaps and therefore not willing to let their best employees move on for further development.

**How do we ensure that there isn't knowledge leaving the organization w/ retirements",,"FSI - Milliken - Craig Haydamack (CHRO) - 5/2/19

•	Craig has been in his role 2.5 years and Milliken since 2014.  He was previously at Intel and a heavy user of the CEB benchmarks.  They have some HR relationships w/ CEB when he moved to Milliken but cut them due to budget pressure years ago.
•	Since then, he hasn’t had any true external support.  He said he googles and reaches out to his network (especially in the Carolinas).
•	Craig’s team – has Comp Dir. Benefits/retirement Dir (Brad Johnson), L&D lead, Technology lead (Stephanie Frazier – hired 5 months ago), and Talent Acquisition (Judy Horton – been there but recently put in new role).  4 HRBPs for the divisions (Dan Garrison and Jean Hall) and 2 Regional HRBP leads.
•	Milliken appointed its first external CEO for the first time in 150+ years.
•	Found an interview Craig gave recently about the transition and he highlighted that HR needs to be able to take the business strategy and translate it to the workforce implications.
•	CO – Growth / Innovation
•	MCP – attract/retain top talent
•	KIs – Craig said that Halsey (new CEO) has identified succession planning and manager/leadership development as his 2 areas of priority.
•	Why?  They have done some extensive analysis of the organization since Halsey has come on.  They know that they have a higher age curve than most companies.  When looking at middle/upper management…over 30% are set to retire within 7 years.  From their analysis and surveys the feedback is clear that they have work to do when it comes to management and leadership roles.  They used to have a formal leadership development program but cut a number of years ago for cost reasons.
•	HR technology component – they are all in with SuccessFactors.  They are overhauling their systems.  For example they do all of their succession planning in powerpoint/Excel currently.  Looking to install succession module from SuccessFactors next year.  Also commented that they are very unsatisfied with perf. Managemen",Christopher Long

Corporate Objective: Mark Cabera has taken over as CEO July 2019 (previous CFO, COO) in a planned Succession. With this the company is focused on double Digit Growth, geographic expansion and broadened portfolio of services. Focusing on 3 key business pillars: Talent, Technology, and Repeatable Processes.

Mission Critical Priorities: HR's Priority is on Talent, and within that umbrella of Talent is 1) the development of their ""High Flyers"" (aka High Potential/future leaders). and 2) Attracting/recruiting of new employees.

Client Initiatives: 
1st priority and biggest pain point is Current and Future Leadership: Helene has 25 ""High Flyers""/HIPOs and she is trying to figure out how to help managers develop them. Their managers are unable to articulate what the development need is and identify what the exercise should be to get them that skill. Her first initiative is to put together a leadership development program to help her HR team train their managers to identify compentency gaps within their High Flyers  then to identify those stretch roles/experiences needed to gain the skill. They do not have formalized career maps in place either yet, which will be a focus.              

2nd priority is Recruiting: They need new and innovative ways identify new sources for recruiting and find folks especially since they are battling against amazon. 

Timeline: wants to have a training program in place by November/December (original timeline was September but that was pushed back due to lack of time/ability for her team to execute).",,"Helene has never had CEB/Gartner access, but her CIO (Donna Slyster) does have IT partnership so she is familiar with Gartner. Helene's team is over 50 people in HR and 11 HRBPs/Managers, however her challenge there is that many of her team members are not as strategic and lack business knowledge which in turn pulls her into the weeds.

Drive culture around this model 
Around all of this - creating a learning culture

They want to accelerate the readiness of the successors they’ve mapped out. They want to use careers (already voiced over experience-based framework) to develop the readiness –lateral movements focused on skills acquisition . The thing is, there is a resistance from the managers to do this –they don’t (1) want someone coming into their team without the technical, hard skills (very skill-intensive industry) and (2) they don’t want to spend time developing someone that does fit their ideal of adequacy. 
•	What’s the root cause? She believes it’s a question of mind-set and change management.
•	What have they done? Mapped out critical roles, people ready, key skills for positions.
•	What do they want to see from us? A clear picture of contrarian vision and strategy implementation. This means, she doesn’t want us to really agree with her, but to challenge her (see suggestion below)
•	Other details? Also an important facet of this is D&I. They’re working on readiness and succession, but within the lenses of D&I –how to get leaders to be “inclusive” leaders in the same sense as above –accepting people who might not fit that profile of what they expect. Want to increase female representation in leadership ranks. We detected in the call that Suzano is using learning agility as a methodology to identify HIPOs… she said she’s confident in this.
•	Who will the conversation be with? Joana (head of HR Strategy and implementation, buyer)
•	My thoughts: If possible, start by painting a picture of immediate correction (learning agility for HIPOs –she needs to see that we’re breaking paradigms) –then, pivot into practices for accelerating readiness within the lenses of D&I.

	Starting from ground zero – haven’t begun process of building this out yet. 
	Identifying mentors is the main challenge at this point
	We have to first develop it. Are giving until end of year to put that in place. We're seeking guidance and best practices to see if any other state agencies/others are doing the same. 
	Ownership – CLO – within the HR function. 

o	Succession management 
	Starting from beginning stages - don’t have anything in place. 
	Career mapping is going to be the first step and will be the hard part about putting a process in place
•	Succession planning – it’s about first identifying ppl that want to do it. They may not be in your own area. And employees don’t know what other positions are in the agency. Doing career mapping – more for the employee to see where they want to be in their career. Not really about who will replace me. But where do they see themselves in this org. 
•	Career mapping is huge – first step – laying It out for employees
•	Pretty much in line with our strat plan. Timline is to have something by end of year. But don’t think we’re going to make that.

LCG has about 1300 employees and lacks gender diversity at pay bands 2-6. They are interested in  succession strategies to improve the ranks of women in these higher levels. They were not able to access the webex so i talked through How to Mitigate Bias in Succession Management, they 100% female slate idea from Equinor would prbably not be accpeted at LCG, but they did like the idea of the inclusion interrupter and the challenge questions. They also have not rolled out any Unconscious Bias Training and would like to do that. I shared the Advancing Inclusion by Overcoming Bias materials and explained how with HRL they could use the materials for internal  training. I also shared a few of the best practice cases from the Development/Succession section. I shared a few more resources around Building Inclusive Teams, ERGs and Metrics to gave them a feel of the breadth of D&I support. To follow-up, I edited the Advancing Inclusion deck in case Hannah decides to share with them.

They aren't awash with candidates in general, but once they've identified candidates (regardless of gender) she is more confident in their selection and conversion ability.  We looked at a few slides from Diversity Recruiting research - the funnel of challenges, a few examples of how to mitigate bias in job descriptions, Roche's use of business case for assessment to avoid some bias.  Katy has a new team member who is doing well in role but had been reluctant to even apply because of whether she met ALL the job description criteria; discussed gender differences in such situations.  She needs to help hiring mangers broaden the skill sets they consider to find qualified candidates.  Decisive Candidate research can also help with challenge she's found of applicants expecting the process to apply to be easy and how orgs can help candidates make decisions and differentiate from the competition.  Referenced a case study of how to highlight non-obvious candidates (sent link to Hannah after call for DuPont: Equivalent Screening Criteria).  Katy has a small team with no dedicated D&I function, so they just want to focus on doing the right things to improve D&I when possible.  Suggested the D&I Score Diagnostic can help prioritize where to focus her energy, get beyond unconscious bias training to mitigating with behavioral nudges, creating inclusive leaders and environments.","PayPoint has a very lean HR team with limited budget. They have only been thinking about D&I in terms of the required gender pay reports. They know their gender pay gap is not good. Their highest paid employee groups are IT and Field Sales and both of these functions are made up of males, which skews their pay gaps. The board/CEO doesn't think they are doing anything ""wrong"" and it's not a priority for 2019 but she knows they need to increase diversity recruiting and decrease the pay gap. Their leaders don't have D&I metrics included in their goals and aren't held accountable.",Elisabeth Joyce

We are in our infancy – D&I
Just starting to put together a policy—education—etc to try to figure out what we want to do
Want it to be deeper—not in the field, primarily in their building—900 person building— (sounds like corporate office/team)
As opposed to stores and 35000 associates
Field is much more diverse and inclusive

So the question is—every time there is an opening in building—make sure there is diverse candidate
Any number of buzz words in industry right now
We are at ground zero

Exploring options
Exploring on our own best practices in Columbus
RETAILERS—
Abercrombie
L brands 
Ascena (justice lane Bryant)
Express
The limited
All a stones throw from where I’m sitting
We know people in all those buildings
Talk to their CHROs regularly
Going about it that way so far

I am intrigued about the idea of someone like Gartner that has a global approach rather than Columbus centric—matters to me and is interesting to me
Get a better sense of what we do
When I look at this list of initiatives—18 things on the list
feels like we’d be getting a lot for 86000 
But what’s behind this
But on the face of it—seems like potential to do a lot for a relatively little amount of $

Becomes much easier thing for me to sell
But not in the budget
But I need to get started on D&I now can’t wait until later this year—

I Mentioned D&I questions from KI deck… 
Short answer—very open minded to whatever you guys bring to the table
No preconceived notions
Wish we had more diverse candidate pool—all kinds of companies out there who will give you lists of people who are diverse—those lists get stale
We can make ourselves appear more attractive in how we advertise the jobs
But we’re not doing any of that right now
Hasn’t been a focus until now",,"Please check the box to include names of Advisors when including their availability. Thanks!

She’s been busy developing and running a development program – their Foundational Leadership Program – which is a 12 month program
This is to develop their up and coming talent
She spent Mon-Thurs this week running the session so today she is working from home

They’ve recently had unexpected org changes which is why she had to postpone our call until today
It’s also the last month of their fiscal year – their FY starts again in April
This is the 4th year of their D&I program
They spent 2018 getting engagement in their strategy
They’ve had big events around Pride and International Women’s Day
She has 2 bosses – one is Steve
They have a Yamr Group where they shared all their IWD stories and made a 2 week celebration of it
Each office came up with their own regional event around IWD and the theme #BalanceforBetter – they have let the offices develop their own events and they are trying to drive feedback from the ground up
They’ve encouraged offices to great videos and podcasts on their experiences
In the Vietnamese office, all the men greeted the women at work with flowers and lunch on March 8th!
Steve is going to publicly share this

They also had a month long observance for the UN day of disability
A lot of disability (including mental health) is hidden so they celebrated it for a month with employee videos – it really brought people together
They’ve also created employee resource groups and promoting more activities on a local/regional office basis

Her worry is: is D&I and our programs sustainable? 

I asked what feedback she’s received so far – from Steve she’s gotten very positive feedback, they’ve also sent out pulse surveys every 6 months to get feedback
She boldly asked Steve for significant budget for D&I and got it!
She’s now wondering how to benchmark and stay on top of D&I trends
She’s been going to a lot of conferences and has looked into Thompson Reuters and other offerings

- Calista is a holding co. - looking to build EVP for just one critical BU.

-MCP for HR: Allow the organization to scale to support the capture of new, larger growth opportunities (new gov't contracts, acquisitions).

- Becoming an employer of choice:  How to create a compelling EVP & employer brand for one of our business units where there is a requirement for highly technical, specialized, hard to find talent? 
-	Many of the government contracts that Calista pursues are for systems integration work for the federal government.  Having the right technical talent in place is a requirement for winning & executing on these large government contracts.  
-	Because this landscape is so competitive, TJ recognizes that the organization has a lot of work to do to become an “employer of choice” that will allow them to attract & retain the right types of talent.
-	TJ is in the initial stages of developing an EVP & employer brand.  The focus for him is on aggregating and analyzing data to determine what the drivers of attraction and attrition are for his organization.
o	His plan for accomplishing this is to scan job boards and glassdoor for reviews and also implement a new, higher-touch exit interview process.
o	We discussed RED and DepatureView as ways to help him collect and analyze that data, and he saw these to be valuable tools for that purpose (doesn’t have a better way to do it right now, would save him a lot of time & effort).
-	Given where TJ is at right now, we’re looking to give him a better sense of the role advisory would play at each stage of developing and rolling out an EVP – with an emphasis on the design & development phases, given where he’s at right now.",Keith Greene

SSG have been working on culture since the organization’s formation in 2016. They have done two rounds of employee engagement surveys (pilot + centralized government run) and have 2 years of data to draw on. They did a 360 for deputy directors and above. Two sessions we ran for them on HIPO and Manager Development also helped to drive the desired culture downwards. They are about to launch another survey “A Great Place to Work” to assess the softer side of things. They are also refining their HR Policy and People Philosophy.

Leadership understands that change will not happen in one year but what they want to see is improvement in previously identified hot spot areas (no specific targets or measures). There is no pressure to get certified but a certification will be a bonus.

1.	Building HR Capability through programs and certifications. Half the team IHRP certified and half career counseling certified

She’s looking to design a performance management strategy, set goals, look at new systems, etc. - the entire performance management lifecycle.

Meeting objectives: Tracey is looking for best practices, insights, etc. when it comes to system recommendations, understanding accountability with the system as well as manager adoption and how does she decouple merit. What are other companies doing to reward employees? How do we attach/evaluate merit in the talent review processes? She is looking to have the right processes in place to create a strong HR department that leads to their growth objectives.

-          What are your most critical deliverables or milestones coming up in the next 6 months that will help deliver upon T22?

One of our most critical deliverables will be delivering our ‘Build’ or Learning components as identified in our Future Workforce Strategy. There are a reasonably large number of focus areas that will require further scoping in order to progress, however a high level view of the key capability areas have been identified.

-          What are the initiatives that underpin them?

Currently, the vast majority have not been scoped therefore do not have initiatives identified as such.  Next steps will be to further understand the size of the population to be uplifted in each area (we have an circa view now) as well as determine whether baselines as required etc.

-          What is the biggest challenge in delivering this?

It will be a significant program of work, that will need to be delivered using a reduced budget that also needs to deliver BAU learning.

-          How are you currently thinking about approaching this?

We are starting to explore this with the learning team but I would say it is early days at the moment.  We have discussed the capability areas, potential populations etc but need to progress further, determine approaches/roadmap etc. 
Very interested in understanding any ways to disrupt traditional learning approaches and the learning team has certainly been looking into this and applying different practices where possible also.

-          Where do you or your team currently feel gapped or under-resourced?
I cannot speak for the learning team (as it is the weekend and I cannot ask them right now!) but it is a large program and team sizes/budgets are reducing.  My thinking is that we may have resourcing pressures at the scoping/design stage of the process.",,"None, all information above.",Justine van Huyssteen

	How do these support the broader Corporate Strategy? 
-	Workforce planning/profiling to support the organisation in the short and medium term linked to profiling and shaping of workforce profiles to match projected short term service changes.
-	Workforce futuring and human capital planning to support longer term 
-	NSW Health Pathology is seeking to prepare for the future of pathology and the impact of: increased automation; AI and robotics; digital pathology.

	What have you tried so far and what’s currently in place? 
-	There has been limited workforce planning in pathology with a focus more on workforce profiling.
-	We have explored approaches in other health agencies which is generally very traditional workforce planning.

	Why is this is challenge? i.e.  you mentioned missing framework, lack of capability? Where may you feel gapped and what would you need to see from Gartner to feel confident we can provide a Return on Investment in this area?

Stephen is interested in a conversation on how Gartner is supporting the Future Of Work. A ""significant"" number of people and roles will be automated so they're trying to understand how HR can get ahead of this. He's been discussing questions like:
- Are we identifying critical roles and leadership skillsets for the future
- Do we have our own HR organization and technology to support the shifting of this work (we have a lot of mixed platforms at the moment)
- What's the best operating model for our company and subsidiaries to support change 

When asked to prioritize Stephen said it's probably the change management piece. How do we get leaders onboard with the notion of reskilling the current workforce and what programs and technologies can we put in place to make the change?  One thing they're considering is offering ""learning hours or days"" that would essentially be like vacation days for employees to spend on learning. They have LinkedIn learning but everyone is expected to do it on their own time/weekends.  Also interested in technology to support the internal mobility associated with this reskilling.","we talked about coca cola 1m hours back, employee experience, organizng hr for change","Zurich Insurance has a North America Business (Zurich NA) and Farmers Insurance in the US.

They are very cost conscious - been tasked with cutting $1.5B out of the organization by end of 2019. They're pacing well on that front but we need to help him understand why support is necessary now to ensure their approach towards this reskilling and internal mobility is a success

Would want to put together a proposed support plan and help him understand the role of advisory and analysts throughout his strategy as he's not very familiar with that aspect of the partnership. He said he's familiar with both CEB and Gartner but Zurich parent currently doesn't have any HR partnerships.

“What I am really looking for is how emerging technologies are impacting our value chain (claims, UW ... product development, etc.) both in terms of jobs creation and displacement.

I would really like to come up either with a quantitative judgement or something which could be less accurate (high, medium, low?).

Now I am aware that it is difficult to find resources which are 100% meeting this need (specifically to Insurance); It could also be ok to have a study which remains a bit high level (ie. impact on transactional activities etc.).

My objective would be to build a framework which we could give to our entities where we help them seizing the effects of emerging technologies on the workforce. This resource could be plugged in a bigger workforce planning process we are building.

She is interested in one team leader and one reference seat (vs 3). Her team is going through an amalgam of what the team would be so she isn’t sure who would take the 3 seats.
They are doing zero based budgeting, so this call was to see if she wanted to put this into the budget instead of an FTE. She won’t know until end of October but based on what she’d heard she thinks this is what they need.

Greg (Head of Talent) will be speaking with Tenet's CEO in two weeks to share his ideas on how Tenet can address this emerging challenge and needs help. Due to this, call needs to happen between 8/27 - 8/29.

Additional Background:
Corp Objective: Tenet is transforming - completing a $250mm cost reduction initiative (including 2k+ layoffs) - and pivoting to focus on core hospital/ambulatory business.
MCP: Build integrated talent processes that will drive retention and performance across the new organization.
KI's:

1. Talent Management - focus on employee engagement, recognition, and change management.

3. Management Capability Building - build development strategy for 1st and 2nd level managers

Focus will be on L&D, specifically how to develop a talent management framework that allows people to move across different business units and embrace developing a broad set of capabilities as way of engaging and retaining top talent. 

Issue really is to hold onto critical talent and interest millenials in joining them. Wnat to have a stronger talent management framework in place. Struggling to get the people to move around much between businesses - she is trying to figure out if that is a people issue (lack of motivation), a process issue or systemisation issue. She thinks L&D generally at the moment acts very siloed across the four business areas, so she is interested in understanding what learning of the future looks like, how they can better create transparency and synergies between the different areas and set up broader organisational talent programs. Connected issues here: Ageing workforce is huge, particularly skilled workers; millenials are not interested in these career paths. Also: They value tentured senior leaders in the org, but that means that there are not many places to move to for HiPos. So it may just also be a cultural shift that needs to happen. What is she going to do about L&D? Here specifically she said she needs to look outside of the organisation - specifically having advisory access and understanding best practice really resonates with her.

This call could be focused on how we can help them—if they have this disruptive technology happening in their industry, what does that mean for HR?  For example, things like helping them figure out which new skills they need, acquiring that critical talent, helping the existing workforce learn new skills, restructuring, career pathing, etc.  If we can talk in general about how we see companies adjusting to the new work environment and can show how we can help do those things, I think that will be successful.

Original:
The Executive Advisor should prepare by understanding how disruptive technology will impact the insurance industry, and how in addition to the cross-industry research we have on this topic, how can the ""practical application"" of these insights be demonstrated to their specific business model (she said the specific HR initiatives will be ""born"" from what they learn, so any specific examples there should be prepared if possible). Focus of the meeting will be proving that we are the right resource to help them ""get smart"" on how disruptive technology will impact their industry and how they do business at their organization (specifically, insure-tech/insurance industry)--How we can help them build a long-term perspective and prepare for the immediate future (next 2-3 years is the 'future').  Right now their business model is based on the past--what do they need to change to prepare for the immediate future (which is essentially now).  This is essential for them to stay a viable business.","Shared a custom deck on HR Transformation, Digitalization and Reskilling. Shared specific data to the Insurance Industry.","This is a small ~300 person company. She's doing this on her own. It would be a single advisory seat partnership.  She is concerned that this is not industry specific, and needs to see the practical application to their business model.  This is something that is highly visible and urgent--She took a meeting with me because their finance team partners with us already and she and her CEO were impressed by the power of the insights. She WILL be buying support to help her get smart and take action on this imitative, and she said she wants to decide ASAP/this month if Garner is the right solution. If not, she needs find to find the other solution before it's too late.",Anna Krasniewska

During her first/second quarter in the role she described that she will be conducting a research project into the best strategy and then will begin focusing on implementation/resourcing after that – she is at very early stages, and is planning on engaging with Korn Ferry and Deloitte. 
 
Her challenge is that she won't have a dedicated team to implement change, although there will be some HR generalists leading the delivery of projects, she will be relying on other members of staff to work on change projects alongside their day jobs. Therefore, she is unsure how to resource the team appropriately to meet the demands and therefore effectively ask people to do work in project in addition to doing the day job. Caroline is worried that the focus will drop from the change projects as members of the team struggle to juggle between their day job stresses and the project they are working on. She is wondering how to mitigate this and what other organisations have done to effectively implement this kind of team in their organisation.

She would therefore be interested in understanding how she should structure / create this team with this challenge. The executive advisor may need to open the discussion with some diagnosing to better understand priorities – but the aim of the discussion will be to showcase how we could support through a seat.","Spoke to Caroline today – she’s in a new role for enterprise change in the people area. Team will look at people led projects, like onboarding better (100 people a month) and also business led projects that require people support like OD changes, M+A work. Generalists with some dedicated /specialist spikes in capability. How to write content, and being able to share it effectively. She has 5 people right now but she will be conducting an experiment esp because it can be tough to do change on top of their day job. Project based work.

They do not have a dedicated consistent methodology for how to do this. Sometimes the language can put people off straight away.

That includes the total function’s budget and staffing costs. You also have a have a high ratio of employees per HR FTEs in the data; that suggests to me that you might be outsourcing, or you’re potentially under-resourced as a team. Interested to get your take?—We do not outsource, we are under-resourced.
	Vendor expense is also low; which can help support the business case for more internal spend—Agreed. 
	HR expense per HR Staff FTE is slightly above the median; so you’re spending more on the staff you do have, and it looks like a lot of your HR budget is going to staffing cost. Would you say you have a relatively seasoned/senior HR staff? Are there opportunities to increase leverage by adding staff at the bottom (e.g., HR coordinator)? Also, are there opportunities for roles to begin to specialize give you have a lot of Generalists.—Yes, agreed.
	Total employee expense per employee FTE (looking at compensation and benefits) is right in line with the benchmark—OK.
	Relatively few employees per executive (so more executives relatively speaking). Is the organization more hierarchical?—Didn’t think we were, but interesting to see that.","What other information?

Your Top Priority: Decrease the high turnover % via manager and leadership development initiatives, HIPO communication and development, and D&I 

Challenges:
•	Recognizing the gaps (lots of VPs and managers promoted beyond their skill set due to heavy acquisition growth) in leadership and managerial development (drive to connector managers)
•	With a relatively lean team in HR and continued expected growth, there is a struggle to maintain focus on strategic objectives (tending to get bogged down in tactical) – filling the director requisition will alleviate some of this
•	Archaic and manual processes – looking to be paperless near beginning of 2019 Q2.
•	Due to growth initiatives – properly sourcing talent and bolstering the talent pipeline (evaluating sourcing methodologies and pipeline process)

Plan & Timeline:
1.	Specific 2019 deliverables around leadership development, D&I, and specific targeted metrics TBD (ie – reduce turnover by x%, garner engagement levels via employee feedback, etc)
2.	Develop businesses case to present to Vicki – directly tying to HealthPoint’s growth goals and project timelines

Next Steps
•	Thursday, Dec 20 @ 11a PST: Further clarify 2019 deliverables and priorities, map back timeline of support, and walk you through the client portal, relevant research, and framework/guides as appropriate
•	At the conclusion of this meeting, we should have all the information we need to develop a business case, to include specific pricing and people/project support.

Key Initiative: Working with the CEO/Board/C-Suite
Core Topics: Board Member Interactions and Senior Executive Succession

In recent Board Meeting, NAV Canada's CEO was told that he needs to ""step it up"" in terms of the information that he is delivering to the board on talent topics - specifically executive level succession. NAV has 12 exec committee leaders, 50% of which will likely retire in next 5 years (including the CEO). The Board wants more robust reporting around executive successors (providing detailed information on each), as well as detailed development plans for exec-level talent.

Ray is interested in best practices around how CHRO's are presenting this data to Boards (format, what is shared, KPI's reported on over time etc.).

Provisioning HR service - HRBP Effectiveness / COEs / Shared Service + Using Talent Analytics",,"Karen Wheeler is the CHRO - Craig Reports to Karen and he is VP of Talent . Here is more background about his issues:
HRBPs
Move to make HRBPs consultative & more strategic
Where does the transactional work they do go to?
Need to free them up to work on strategic activities –and equip them with the right skills. HRBPs are aligned by client group. 4 main groups 
1.	Defense Systems
2.	Civilian
3.	Airforce
4.	Cyber / Training 
Under those 4 leaders are additional HBRPs to support mgmt. matrix – about 25 in total. 
What is perception of HR from business? Not Homogenous – 
Biggest challenge – working with business to think about how to work with HR & HRBPs; there are also pockets where skills of HRBP may be in issue. Briefly showed HRBP tools + BAT 
Milestones: Want to have a way of communicating with the business / SLA – that makes it clear how to engage / where we support. Discussed BAT. 
On this topic Craig also said: what are frameworks / best practices for delivering different parts of HR to different business models.

Talent Analytics
For him personally, he is mostly interested in using analytics effectively
And increasingly interested in improving the general sophistication around HR thought processes as it relates to data
For instance, Finance has a common language and a consistent mental model for how to talk and to make decisions
And that’s what he’d like to do: have a framework & a model to enable the company in a more consistent way
A lot of conversations devolve into nothingness … if you look at a turnover number, people say “that’s good because we want to refresh” vs. others say “that’s bad because we need to bring people on”
Turns into locations, levels, ages, etc. 
Wants to be able to say “this is good, this is bad” more definitely
And so it’s really hard to deploy HR services
HR data – currently at a very low maturity level.  No roadmap, no way to proactively engage with business. Reactive – receive requests, 
Goal – don’t have a good reason for doing st",Anna Krasniewska

For an organization where the goal is higher employee satisfaction and performance, how do we make a recognition program that directly impacts these metrics? How do we collaborate with other areas of the organization to promote a recognition culture, especially among leadership?","We had a great discussion with Elizabeth and Danielle today. I opened with an overview of the TRIP and the corresponding research on designing employee recognition programs. From there, I segued into the UBP, showing them how they could segment that data by industry and geography. Next, I showed them what to *do* with that data, by emphasizing the relevant IG. Finally, I tied it all together with a brief segue into benefits communication. After all, even if they get this right, it will all be for naught, if no one uses it! Overall, I thought the call went well. Both prospects reported that my guidance was in line with what Danielle had described and that they understood how they could use it within IADB.","IDB has very high retention (they still offer pensions), so turnover isn't an issue, but they do have an issue with employees being happy in their job and performing well as a result. They recently completed an employee engagement survey and know that the question ""have you been recognized within the last 7 days"" did not have good results. 

As far as HR structure, the overall team is broken down into a few divisions (https://www.iadb.org/en/about-us/departments/hrd) and Elizabeth is the deputy chief on the COB team over benefits/pay design. IDB serves tens of countries in Latin America, so they have a very global perspective when thinking about TR. 

As far as timeline, Elizabeth said this recognition project is still in the brainstorming phase and will last at least a year. She knows that leadership will pin this initiative on her team, so she wants to be prepared with a strategy. They are totally starting from scratch and are interested to see how Gartner could help them successfully implement without reinventing the wheel. The project will have high visibility, so it's important that they do it right.",Keith Greene

Chris Smith, NTR Head of HR as of December, was brought in to transform the HR function from a transactional function to a strategic function that supports broader business goals.
 
Chris’ main priority is to re-structure the HR function. Big multi-million dollar question is: What should they centralize at corporate for HR and what should they localize at their properties?
•	“Last year, before I came in, we went to a very centralized model and very fast. It didn’t go well. We may want to do CoEs (L&D, comp, benefits, HRIS systems). Recruiting is still debated if this should be centralized or localized. And also for team member/employee relations will be localized.”
 
Gartner HR support will be most valuable for Chris because he needs an advisor. There aren’t any tenured executives at Boyd who have done projects like this before that have HR backgrounds. He needs someone to bounce ideas off of & to use as a trusted advisor.

The prospect got back to us and said that they are using SAP Success Factors and JAM.

Is it possible that we could align Executive Advisor Michael Hanrahan to this call? He has worked with us in the past on best practices in social, collaborative learning. Since they already have the technology, I think it will be more around “what are other companies doing in the space of social learning” and “what are best practices in on demand/elearning?” After the POC, we can explain how an Analyst would tackle the technology initiatives themselves, but I think for the sake of this initial call, an Advisor might be better.

Original: 
What are the trends/best companies doing in social collaborative learning/on demand learning? What are best practices with nano, curated E Learning? Should we be using something like Linkedin or a smaller vendor? How do we implement it with our LMS?

We could not find out who the new VP of HR was, which is why I went after Glenn (he was the most senior person I could find). During our conversation, Glenn told me that the new VP of HR is an engineer who was the VP of Commercial Ops and has never been in HR before. Glenn also said that he would like this POC to be very business and ROI focused.

Jason Gorham is the VP of HR and his immediate reports, Rachel Heisten, Director of Succession & Talent Acquisition, and Alissa Owsley, Director of Learning and Development, will be leading these initiatives in 2019. 

Alissa manages the learning and leadership functions (programs, consulting and development). More specifically, she manages the HIPO and emerging leaders process. Rachel manages succession planning and PM, but also oversees TA.

Organizational Context: L&P is experiencing a lot of change because they just completed the largest acquisition they’ve ever gone through and there is a brand new C-suite and they expect there to be a lot of senior level transition within the next 2 years. They’re currently going through the “silver tsunami” as they deal with a massive retirement wave. As a result, the executives are experiencing acute pain and now there is a sense of urgency to fix these pains, which HR is being tasked with completing. With the rapid pace of change within L&P’s culture and people, they don’t have the right talent or enough people to get them to where they need to be. 

They just hired an external CFO, which is a huge deal – they haven’t done that in more than 40 years. Their new COO has strong opinions around the performance of the employees as a whole and the business is really starting to understand the connection – in L&P’s history, they didn’t focus on PM as they should have because they didn’t have buy in from the top. The attitude and cultural difference between the leadership teams is very drastic and they need the business to accept these new changes since it's more innovative than ever before.",,"HR Context: Specifically, there has been a lot of turnover in the HR leadership team within the last 3-4 years. Jason’s predecessor trained the executive team to believe that HR is solely tactical and not important. They finally have the team in place that no longer believes they are just “ticket holders,” so they are experiencing a huge cultural shift as the business starts to view them as strategic partners. They have used SuccessFactors in the past, but have never been able to optimize the technology because they didn’t have buy in from the top. Their process and technology need tweaks, but they are focusing on the fundamental things first. 

HR Priorities: They are trying to come up with a more connected talent management system so the employees see the value and what they do in performance appropriately influences succession. All of the gaps identified in performance are connected to development plans for the employees. The biggest challenge they see fundamentally is helping employees and managers understand that PM is not optional or something “HR does,” but rather important and valuable for the business and career pathing. 

In this upcoming meeting, they would like to see how other companies are building competency into their PM process. Right now, they have just have company values that are associated with certain behaviors, but it’s too general – it needs to be blown up and completely redone in order to get to where the business needs to go. They are also focusing on ramping up total rewards and evolving L&D programs, so pay for performance metrics would be helpful to share.",Christopher Long

Can we make this 45 minutes?,,"Here is the background about Carrie's situation: Our foundation is cracking
Emergency mode – payroll team is cracking; looking for outsourced solution 
Trying to pull shared services together 

From Culture and Talent Processes perspective – have outside consultant working on those to keep the train moving while Carrie is focusing on Shared Services / Transformation efforts. 

What necessitated the change?
1980s model of HR – largely generalists, processing payroll errors
No level of tiered service model 

Want to pull scalable / repeatable activities into shared service . reactive HR model. 

No focus on how we move talent forward
Talent assessment + skill gaps + career pathing – which we spoke about ~10 months ago, those are still relevant. Now I have players in role. 

When payroll moved from Finance to HR – everything imploded , took over 100 hotels, didn’t have scalable process in place; completely re-do architexcture
Driving difficult culturatal conversations with the business 
Structure of HRBP team – 2 in place embedded and assigned by business line – generalists under them.
Pretty far long with that effort – 
Do they have the skills? Yes, but still learning have some work to do. 
Used Gartner’s HRBP competency model. 
What’s challenging? 
Business expectation / business process. HR is not sticking in the field because they don’t have expectation. 

Went through HRBP challenge – 50% of equation is skills ‘/50% is barriers within business – we support HRBPs in skill developing and unlocking these challenges. 

Shared Diagnostic + Masterclasses – 

She said she participated in this diagnostic two years ago – the problem was .. what now? Addressed that by showing IDPs + also discussing difference in Gartner service model.

She said she’s also going to establish certain metrics in perf. Evaluation to make this happen. Asked WHEN –she said by end of year, she needs a turn around.  Asked which processes, she said they really aren’t focused on any –like, distributing bonus or communicating about this; succession and development are key because they don’t have successors, so successor development. But the big question is WHY they don’t do it. She attributed it to culture –that this isn’t part of the culture for them.

-being asked to take on more engagement with perf and career convso…haven’t traditionally been asked to do these things.
-are in a tougher economic environment affects this too
-culture change for leaders (large org with a very deep culture)

They’d like to know, “what’s happening in the environment that’s affecting the way people working”

Grant had shared in prep: “how we can support their Leadership Development priority and prepare leaders for more accountable career conversations to improve performance and engagement.”
-They said, more focused on the development planning that comes after managers have career convos with employees. 

I showed them: Action Plan: Leadership Development Strategy to describe more broadly how we could support. I stressed the importance of identifying the leadership skills needed in the future (Enterprise Leadership Capability Audits)
-They agreed and mentioned what’s above
I walked through Enterprise Leadership in Digital Age
-They asked, what are the right competencies to enable Enterprise Leadership?
-They said, this may be a bit too progressive for them. They said they really need to build foundational management skills/fundamental competencies. Also standardize the way in management happens across the org.
-I recommended that they take the L&D Ignition Diagnostic to gauge functional maturity levels so we know the right starting point
-I also shared that we’d discuss different case study options and figure out which solutions would be the best fit for them.

Their Talent Acquisition leader attended Reimagine and would like to be included in the support moving forward as we look to renegotiate their contract.

We started working with them on Performance Management and Talent Reviews, and they have made great strides on succession planning and SWP but realized they have not prepared managers/leaders for how to work in the new era. They migrated their Performance Management system to Workday and have evaluated no ratings in employee focus groups. They had no ratings for director level and above previously for USA but everyone got ratings in Europe. 

So while we can support them on some of this in CLC/DIWC, it would be great to focus this conversation on how we can support their Leadership Development priority and prepare leaders for more accountable career conversations to improve performance and engagement.",Michael Hanrahan

1)	Leadership Mindset Change: Big challenge is that there’s changes in organizational structures, with agile teams and squads. This has an implication for the mid-level leaders and senior-level leaders at the organization –how they manage, not through control/authority, but through a more open perspective –encouraging learning, encouraging more autonomy of teams, and in which they don’t “know everything.” Part of this is how to get leaders bought into this alignment towards a more digital culture, but leaders end up prioritizing short-term deliverables rather than long-term gains (sharing talent; self-development; developing direct reports).  The methodology they’re using to change leadership mindset is through 1) Training –so, using internal leaders to give them information on why they should change and 2) CEO engagement –leveraging him to encourage the new leadership style); 3) Mapping out leadership Journey.

Until recently, they have never done anything to act upon the fact that their costs are completely out of control. 
The ownership structure has stayed the same despite the growth which has caused significant problems. For example, they have been investing in systems for ‘quick wins’ but not getting the most out  of them at all- wasting money.  
Difficult FY2017 and slightly better FY2018 because they had been pressed so heavily on budgeting. 
Richard thinks the only way to get them out of their current situation is to bring new ownership equity into the mix. The best outcome for them business wise is to become part of another business.

One of the key metrics Kathy is focused on reducing is time to fill, currently she's at 75 days currently and her struggle is lack of benchmark data to know where she stands currently and what should be her target metric. They're spending over $1 million a year on recruiting and really need to reduce time to fill, improve their candidate selection/quality. One issue with sourcing Kathy mentioned is with the length of time it takes recruiters to present to hiring managers and then the time for them to get candidates into the office for interviews. Best practices to overall reduce time to fill and improve efficiency of sourcing are her interest.

Currently they have 24 open recs (likely to increase) and each rec is an individually distinct job. She's struggling wiht ""how to manage a diverse pool of recs in a tight labor market where they're looking for specific skills"".


Kathy is also thinking about leveraging Gartner to help her create a ""strategy on a page"" and a metrics dashboard. Kathy knows time to fill being one of the metrics she'll be focused on tracking which relates to the larger recruiting initiative, but she needs help determining the rest of the specific metrics specifically she should be tracking within her dashboard and needs benchmark data.  Retention of salary employees isn't an issue (2% monthly) however retention of new hourly employees is very high within the first 60-90 days (in 2018 of the 240 offers accepted they only have 171 on payroll now) which she thinks is related to recruiting efforts.

BIGGEST CHALLENGE THEY FACE IS CHANGE MANAGEMENT--separate businesses will look at this as a loss of control. 
Change management—600000 employees globally, large org
Our divisions have kind of operated as businesses
The businesses have been running this way for years—so change management and cultural change is really big
How do we manage this change and communicate this effectively?
Teri shared that they already know this is the right thing to do/what they’re going to do
Biggest piece for them is going to be around change management",,"Sherwin haven’t had to change/large changes ever—large acquisition two years ago
We’ve grown a lot, but ways of working haven’t changed a lot
Key is In messaging and all that good stuff
We’re just starting
CHALLENGE: Perceived loss of control will be biggest challenge
No longer posting jobs and shuffling resumes through a system
They know it’s a different skill set, but so much HR staff that have done that",Anna Krasniewska

Bradesco is facing strong competition for talent in the Brazilian market. They don’t want to just hire anyone, they want “only the best” –for all roles. At the same time, Bradesco traditionally just hired entry level roles and developed up, but now they’re hiring people into middle management and above which requires more of a “hunter” profile for their recruiters. They see that, because the recruiting process is long and inefficient, they’re losing key talent to competitors. They need to correct this to 1) improve organizational efficiency and 2) attract and convert top-quality candidates.
•	What’s the root cause? One that they’ve corrected for is in-person interviewing –they’ve shifted this to virtual to alleviate time drags. Another is a lot more CVs –that they all spend time reviewing . Another is just a lot of processes that they feel they have to go through –they are more process driven than people driven, and want to switch this so they spend more time interviewing and analyzing the candidate.
•	What have they done? Beyond the switch to virtual interviewing, not too much to address this #1 problem.
•	What do they want to see from us? A clear picture of use and capability. This is important –they know the quality of the research, but a lot of the conversation will be understanding how you’re guiding them to creating a strategy to resolve this challenge and how these interactions are recurring and thought-provoking.
•	Metrics? Current time-to-fill is 48 days (a  drop from 72) but they want to get to 30.
•	Other details? They believe that recruiters are mostly transactional, all have a profile based of having graduated with degrees in psychology. 
•	Who will the conversation be with? Victor (HR director) and Marcos (kind of like PMO for HR function)","Bradesco - 5/10/2019

How they should use technology in recruiting
Capability framework for TA, but this is a later focus",,"•	Recruiting Transformation - Her role is to come in and look at TA in CCEP and figure out what to do about this, she has been there for 8 weeks so far.  She needs to look at what’s there, and what they should do, this comes under the banner of “one HR” which is all about modernizing their HR function and be more agile etc.  They hire 4500 people a year and have 50 recruiters. 

Specifically, now she is focused on what model they should have.  At the moment they have different models in different countries (v decentralized and partly because CCEP was formed from 3 companies coming together), so they are trying to figure out what the structure should be going forward. There are different views across the HRLT as different things work well in different countries. What will work well for them? What are other companies doing? Help them with the decision. 12 June is the deadline to present on the model and what.

What’s most challenging – there is not the opportunity to increase headcount, so they need to think how they can organize themselves more effectively. 

The next step is then to think about the capability framework for a TA function – This is her other big challenge, but can only talk in more detail when they figure the model out.

How to use technology to support the function - They have about 50 recruiters across their countries. How to meet all needs for all geographies. It’s interesting that there is a sense of pace around this, One HR has been looking at this for a long time, so they need to start making recommendations soon.  Other challenge is the lack of understanding / awareness of technology and how technology can free up technology, some people just don’t know what that can look like. How much automation should they have, and how can it free up peoples time etc. How this will shape the function.",Christopher Long

Should they build internally or use another RPO vendor? Are there parts they can bring internal and outsource others?
How can they get better at workforce planning to anticipate needs and appropriate resource?

Vendor is under-delivering and contract is up at end of year which is good timing to think about what is the best way to move forward.

Kelly is a reference seat. I have made the recommendation to upgrade her access to advisor based on recruiting strategy and function needs moving forward as well as her compensation and rewards communication initiatives. The thought at Armstrong is that the need for advisory will 'go away' once they have a few calls. Is it really worth the investment? The goal of this call is to help her understand we won't solve for this in one advisory call, and that she would be best served through a SERIES of advisory calls as she continues to tackle. In the past she has used the Team Leader to host calls but that often gets delayed (scheduling/capacity) and they are not working on the same projects.

I am having direct conversations with the CHRO on the renewal (6/30)  and she is the ultimate decision maker, but we need to get Kelly to advocate for this upgrade based on the personal value she'll be able to gain through advisory partnership.",Justine van Huyssteen

Attracting top tech talent –especially experienced employees. Also, have to attract all those people that are common needs of other companies (data scientists, App developers)

Why is this hard? Top tech talent in Brazil doesn’t see B2W as a place for them to work. They go to start-ups, or other companies that are entering Brazil strong like Google or Amazon.",,"What have they done to address this?
•	They usually proactively go after passive employees. They do this either through their own recruiters, or head-hunter services. Then, they try to sell the value of working at B2W. Many times it can boil down into a negotiations of strategy
•	They are going to try  something similar to AT&T case, and have  day where they bring top people to their org and have a tech activity, and get to let them know what it’s like to work at the organization

What are they considering to do?
•	Redeploy recruiters in a different format
•	Rethink how they are going-to-market with these people

How do they plan to measure this?
•	No real measure now, this is something they’d like to work on. Looking at basic things like when the employee comes in and leaves, just filling roles

Other points to know
•	I asked if retention of these people were a problem too, and he said yes –in the sense that they had an expectation of employment and it turned out to be different, and also cultural fit wasn’t right
•	Recruiters are selling the opportunities, and they handle 90% of roles (both for warehouses and for corporate roles). They are open to knowing more about how rethinking recruiter role could help them. Recruiters are generally basic, younger, background in HR but don’t know business
•	I asked about EVP/Branding: they are almost done creating their EVP, hired a company to do this. UNSURE of how to communicate this through branding to different areas, and how this will get done
•	Also looking at WF needs for competencies in digital environment, changes to performance management that accompany this, and how this related to development and careers.

Suggested points to include 
Of course this is up to you, but I’d think:
•	Lockheed best practice and implementation device
•	Profile of recruiter
•	Best practice for Thomson Reuters, and implementation device
•	Recruiters as career coaches
•	EVP creation/Branding Workshop case from that one company that did work",Elisabeth Joyce

Thank you for your time this morning. While it was a brief 20-minute call, I left the conversation confident in the alignment between Delaware North and Gartner for HR. I am bullish on the alignment because Gartner has supported hundreds of other HR Leaders in your industry set company-wide targets for Talent Acquisition, Onboarding, Development, etc. with our validated benchmarking data and diagnostics. Once we help you establish the appropriate targets, we then help you take action through expert advice & tools to quickly improve in key areas like Quality of Hire, Time to Fill, and Cost per Hire. 

I briefed one of our experts on your specific situation at Delaware North and he would be happy to provide a tailored view of our Talent Acquisition Metrics/Effectiveness support to make it easy for you evaluate whether there is value in the partnership for you.  I have attached brief overviews on Gartner HR’s Benchmarking resources, RED, and the Gartner for HR service to provide more details on our services.

Notes:
Currently there are some system limitations

8 key metrics he gave Holly
Application, completion rate, 
Did not have a mobile application before. Half of the hires are technicians who work on their phones. Working on a quick apply method. On the phone.
Had not been tracking applicant sources and effectiveness. 
Track cost per hire
Entire TA budget doesn’t fall under Billy. Government work bill it to the Gov, not included in his payroll.
Time to fill - system limitation. ATS is a bit dated. 
Lots of technician requisition. Job doesn’t close until the whole lot is closed.
Retention on new hires. 
Quality of hire. Scorecard for this.
Diversity scorecard. They are not tracking very well.
Implemented a global recruiting workflow to look at the entire process, identify areas of redundancy, areas to combine resources. All to speed up the time.
Created some SLA with the team 
Size of team: 
Happy with the structure of the team. 
Before all recruiters worldwide reported to him. 
Now there’s a gulf of mexico lead
A Lead in Aberdeen - europe and middle east. 
Need a person on the ground in Angola
6 people in india 
Government side - don’t have a lead. (advanced technology) 
Growing quite quickly in Brazil and Mexico. No one on the ground in either location. 
No one in Norway.

Someone who can help Shannon get a better picture of what it would look like as a client as we support her on all things talent analytics (along with employee experience and engagement). She’s thinking through what data to display on the HR dashboards and answering what are some common people metrics other companies are using. It doesn’t need to be too technical – I’m hoping she can walk away with a better feel for how a partnership would unfold as we support her and work with her on these initiatives - less on the technical side. 

Original: 
3 buckets to solve for re: HR analytics:

1.) determine what HR analytics should we be tracking - they have the data, but what's the best way to analyze and use it, and what SHOULD we be tracking? Also, how do we get this into dashboards? IT can support, but they need to know what HR should be displaying.
2.) how do we position these analytics to our Board and tell a compelling story? - how do we show the impact that HR is having on the organization's broader strategic objectives? 
3.) what action should we take as a result of the data? - once we've informed the board on progress, how then do we use data/talent metrics to drive action across the organization? how do we get stakeholder buy-in on taking action? what do we communicate to our managers and staff?

There's also a need to improve the employee experience and engagement. The attrition rate is pretty good hovering at  around 6%(they report this monthly to the board), but of the staff that are there how many are disengaged and how many are engaged?  Right now they're using employee engagement surveys to measure - are there other ways of collecting inputs on engagement?  What are they?",,"Suzanne Mitchell is the senior most and SVP of HR and training, and who Shannon reports in to. Both Suzanne and Shannon were on the first two diagnose calls, and Shannon is the point person for HR analytics on the team. Suzanne has been set up with a POC call with Maureen in two weeks to cover the grounds relating to the board positioning and talent analytics (Shannon will likely join that call, too).  We're planning on an Advisor seat for Shannon so it would be great for her to learn how we would support her as the HR analytics point person, specifically, and in support of Suzanne and the HR team.",Christopher Long

Rahim wanted to discuss job leveling, although he's already completed this exercise at DAN and is very confident in this space. As such, I adopted some challenger scripting. I opened with the job leveling benchmarks and IG, but I quickly pivoted to the National Grid diamond shaped career paths and the Intel example from IT. In doing so, I deliberately disagreed with him and emphasized that, even if he were to get his levels right, it will all be for naught if he can't convince folks to move between job families.

o	Ensure they level set with current state – what is meeting or not meeting needs, where are needs that aren’t being met
o	Search for best practices, market, what are others doing, applying bps to their unique requirements. Maybe moving to another HRIS platform. Haven’t considered over last few years because it would be “dead on arrival”.

Secondly, people are starting to make comparisons. And thirdly, they are not seeing the returns on their investment – trying to rationalize assets but the majority of assets OC is declining.

What are employee preferences? what are STI trends? Right now we have a peanut butter spread approached -  we need to drive the right beviors through rewards and recognition.","Notes:
•	Barbara – have been with MSC for 20 years in finance and HR (ben for half, comp for half). 
•	P4p – don’t have differentiation today. Hard when we’re dealing with small budgets 
•	Raise the bar initiative – around performance. Transforming from catalog provider to advisor/associate role. Ask – is this associate someone that I would re-hire?
•	How are you currently approaching performance and pay differentiation?
o	Raising awareness around the company – what’s acceptable and what’s no longer acceptable – formalizing that 
o	Looking at sales commission plan – partnered with Aon to help with plan design last year – focus on variable commission plan – clear goals and expectations
o	Bonus plan – reward people on multipliers 
o	Implemented SAP success factors / performance management changes
o	Feedback from managers is that PM is time consuming / feedback from managers that it’s a daunting task 
o	Looking at LTI 
o	Butch has taken the lead on coaching/training with managers
•	Senior leaders are bought in. Need to put accountability on managers – to understand, engage, be comfortable in having conversations 
•	P4p scatterplot challenge resonates 
•	Manager mindset is that everyone steps 
•	Mindset change for the company to buy in to p4p – even at top levels
•	We need those people in the mighty middle
•	She’s interested in digging in to LTI vehicles 
o	What do companies offer and what motivates employees? 
•	Getting managers to understand how to differentiate performance so we can reward off of that",MSC is a CLC member with a new CHRO who has not seen enough value and is looking to drop CLC upon December anniversary.

How to create a reward philosophy, and light touch reward strategy quickly (Getting a ""reward north star"" – this is his main focus. They have fixed the basics and have plans of where to focus but they lack the strategic content and the overarching philosophy is needed.  This call is to show him how we can help him to do this and why he should buy a membership base don this need.

How to drive performance with pay, ie getting the bonus structure on stores right. 

Context:
Burberry had not been growing, so they got a new CEO (Marco Gobetti) about 1.5 years ago who has really shaken things up. He created a two stage strategy: 
1) Building Foundation FY 2018/19 and 2019/20 - driving efficiencies for growth - aims to deliver £135 million annualised cost savings
2) Accelerate growth  FY 2020/21 onwards
The focus is now growth.

***HE ASKED IF THIS COULD HAPPEN  21 AUG IN AFTERNOON UK TIME /// OR ANY TIME ON 22 AUG PLEASE***",,"-	Stuart was Head of TR at Pearson and had a reward membership for years, but never interacted with us much.
-	They have done stuff to get the basics right so far and thought about CEO pay etc, but they need a strategy and an overarching philosophy. The lack of one worries him.
-	He doesn’t have 6 months to create this, he needs to come up with it at the same time as actually delivering on CEO pay etc. 
-	He is worried there is no strategic thinking in the reward decisions they have made so far. Example, he feels people just fixed problems when they arose, paid people what they needed to be paid to get them, but not strategic, because there is no strategy / philosophy.
-	Timeline – NOVEMBER – Needs to begin sharing strategy/thinking with shareholders then. Ultimately it needs to be fully ready for July 2020 (I think he said this is when the REMCO is). But it starts being talked about in March, and principals will be shared with shareholders in Nov. 
-	Needs to be simple and light touch.
-	Difficult? – He doesn’t know the context of Burberry yet, doesn’t understand processes and why decisions have been made in the past, and because his team are all so new, they can’t really help him either. Also a tight timeline and need to deliver on things now.  New team.
-	Struggling to find out context and why they are doing what they do? He needs to join the dots and create their REWARD PHILOSOPHY. This will give them consistency and clarity, which seems to be lacking.  
-	Problem is that reward strategy isn’t really on the agenda.
-	They work with Deloitte, they are exec comp advisors and advise their renumeration committee. Help with remco too, very technical stuff. hey aren’t helping with the strategic side, Stuart doesn’t want them to. 
-	At Pearson, they made a lot of changes in reward, but never really had a reward strategy or north star. He wants to learn from this. It didn’t cause problems at the time, but he thinks they missed opportunities. Eg.How they support managers",Aaron Kloch

How can she improve those relationships for the success of the business and as the head of HR?",,"Working with the Board: Tifini is a part of a sub-committee on the board with 2 other Board members. She has to report to them on a bi-monthly basis. This is  a new way they are working in order to increase the involvement of the Board within the business priorities. She has one board member who is from large organizations who she is particularly looking to impress given it will likely be more challenging. 
Tifini will have to feed them the right questions, data, and information about HR to confidently go back to each Board meeting with updates.
We want to use this to help improve her credibility and continue putting HR at the forefront of being a strategic driver for the business.

I attached HR's business plan not to be reviewed, but for additional context on their HR priorities. Company has been working really hard on its foundation and now on a 2019-2021 strategic plan as an organization to  growth and progress as an organization. 

Damar is non for profit organization. 

Tifini: Use this POC because budget is extremely tight across Damar. She may be able to move around some consulting dollars, and she said she would likely be able to do that if she really impresses the board member from the larger companies in the past.  If we can knock this out of the park, she will upgrade.",Anna Krasniewska
